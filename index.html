        <h2>1. The First Online Meeting </h2>
        <p>
            Bob, Glen, and I had a chat about the playable street and the initial 
            intention to build the site, as well as my interests and how can I work on 
            the projects. I had a brief idea of what playable street is doing and the 
            general introduction of its many projects.

        <p>
            Glen and I had in-depth on the projects the playable street team is working on, 
            and how my interest in web development and making interactive installations 
            using pure data would help benefit the development. Our discussion focuses 
            both on the technology side and the design part.

        <p>
            Glen and I had chats about some interesting interactive websites that could 
            be helpful for us to develop the Kidstrument project. Then we move on to discuss 
            how pure data could possibly work for interactivity. I took the challenge to make 
            a PD patch from scratch to achieve interactions through pressing the key W.

        <h2>4. In-person meeting at Northcote studio</h2>
        <p>
            At playable street’s 25A studio in Northcote, I spent the afternoon with Bob, 
            Glen, and Cayn to work, discuss and brainstorm on making the physical DIY instruments 
            as well the website. Our discussion covers ideas on web design and specific technology 
            to achieve the interactions. Also, Bob lead me to keep working on the PD patch, 
            debugging, and refining. It’s a unique experience to work collaboratively with 
            professionals from different areas.

        <h2>5. Focus on developing the Kidstrument site</h2>
        <p>
            In the meeting with Bob and Gleb, we decide that I will focus on developing the 
            website and adding or changing functions to the original website. I’m able to 
            join playable street’s GitHub page and learn to work collaboratively with branch 
            management on GitHub. Apart from that, I also had the chance to know more about 
            web hosting on platforms such as Netlify.

        <h2>6. Get hands-on experience with P5.js and tone.js</h2>
        <p>
            Under Bob’s advice, I had the chance to have a close look at the two javascript 
            libraries, P5.js and tone.js. It’s helpful for me cause it’s the first time I 
            use both two libraries in one project. There are many detailed issues such as 
            naming the IDs carefully and making sure the two frameworks wouldn’t conflict 
            with each other. This task showed the importance of having eyes that care for 
            details in a complex real-world context.

        <h2>7. Adding a new feature to the Kidstrument site</h2>
        <p>
            After analyzing the existing website, from the perspective of user experience. 
            I made a prototype on Figma for the new music player feature so that Glen and 
            Bob can review it and give me feedback. We all think this new function and 
            interface could benefit the Kdistruments website and its user experience. 
            So I started to build it from scratch, which requires me to do the research 
            and implement it with the existing framework. This work improves my ability 
            to work indepently and my problem-solving skills dramatically.

        <h2>8. Keep developing the site and working on layouts</h2>
        <p>
            In the meeting with Glen and Bob, I was able to demonstrate the new functionality. 
            Further, we had some user tests, and find out the website was not responsive 
            for mobile devices. So, based on this real-world problem, I was able to keep 
            developing and improving the layout under Bob’s supervision.
